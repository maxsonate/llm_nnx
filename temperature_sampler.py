  Args:
    prompt_inputs: array: [batch_size, max_decode_len] int32 sequence of tokens.
    init_cache: flax attention cache.
    tokens_to_logits: fast autoregressive decoder function taking single token
      slices and cache and returning next-token logits and updated cache.
    prng_key: JAX PRNGKey.
    temperature: float: sampling temperature factor. As it approaches
      zero this becomes equivalent to greedy sampling.
    topk: integer: if nonzero only use the top-k logits to sample next token,
      if zero don't use any cutoff and sample from full logits over vocabulary.
    topp: float: if nonzero, use top-p sampling.
    eos_token: int: end-of-sentence token for target vocabulary.
